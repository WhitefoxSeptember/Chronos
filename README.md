# EECS494 Project 3

## Game Dev Note
### Controls:

1. WASD: basic movement
2. Mouse: perspective 
3. Space: jump/grab the ledge (when player is close to it and is in air)
5. Left shift: crouch 
6. Right click: point camera
7. Left click: take photo

## Development Guide
A good practice is that for one feature that we propose, create just one issue on Jira, and create just one pull request for that on Github.
The detail guidance is moved to the wiki page [Development Guide](https://github.com/UM-Electra-Studio/eecs494-p3/wiki/Development-Guide)
